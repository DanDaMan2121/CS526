# Problem 1
# What is the advantage of using a tail pointer in a linked list?

One of the biggest advantages of a tail node is the ability to traverse the linked list from the beginning and end simultaneously.
This allows for an easy way to get the reverse order of a linked list, and it takes half the time it would take to iterate through the linked list.
Another advantage is that you can easily remove and append elements to the back of the linked list since you have a reference.
