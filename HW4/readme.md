## Problem 1a
Preorder Sequence
A, B, E, H, F, I, C, D, G

Breath-first sequence
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I

Postorder sequence
H, E, I, F, B, C, G, D, A

## Problem 1b
In-order tree traversal
D, G, B, E, A, C, H, F, I

## Problem 2
Sort the array in descending order so that the biggest numbers are first. Add numbers one by one from largest to smallest. Stop when the sum exceeds the target T. Count the numbers added thatâ€™s the smallest number of elements needed.

## Problem 3
Each point in my algorithm is treated as a pivot and computes the angles to all other points. Then it checks all pairs of these vectors to see if the angle between them is 90 degrees. Every pair found is counted, resulting in the total number of unique right triangles.
